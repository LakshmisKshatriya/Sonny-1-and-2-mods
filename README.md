Daniela's WIll

Mod Name : Daniela's WIll

Release Date: 04.10.2021

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's this Mod?

This Mod changes many things like:

    enemies
    allies
    one ability in the skill tree
    The Infinity

The infinity now has extra stages which have story dialogues and explain one theory of mine how they came to New Alcatraz. (Dont take it to seriously) The Gunslinger, Guardian (allies) and Veradux have new abilities and the extra allies that come at the infinity now make sound effects when hit. (EX: Teco makes ZPCI hit sound). Some Examples for the enemies&fights: The ZPCI Hunter miniboss in Gadi'kala now is a bossfight and is harder. The Shaman boss is also harder. Blood Strike now is Speed Fire. This ability scales with your speed and a bit with your strength.

Sonny 2 Impossible Difficulty Mod

Mod Information

Mod Name: Sonny 2 impossible Difficulty

Mod Release Date: Probably 08.10.2021
What does this Mod change?

This Mod basically changes everything except your allies and Sonny!

Every Enemy has better Stats except Zone 7 ones. Most Enemies have more abilities! This Mod includes 100+ Abilities and of course a high amount of new Buffs! I also added a special thing for Bosses! The Enrage Sequence. Every Boss after Felicity has an Enrage Timer if they pass Example turn 70 they'll reach their next phase and you will probably die because they cast their ability which scales 9999999% with their power! Some Stages are changed like the first Frost Zombie fight is the Frost lord and the Frost lord fight is an entirely new fight w/ new enemies. Some Achievements are changed. After The Corrupter you'll fight a really hard boss!

Also as everyone knows the mayor doesnt have a Death sound because of a mistype, so I replaced his hit_mayor.mp3 with a secret Soundeffect and used it as a Soundeffect for some abilities in the game.
ACHIEVEMENT?

Defeating the game without using training fights is not the hardest obtainable achievement anymore!
BALANCEMENT?

With Psycho its possible to beat the mod. With Hydro I got til the Tunnel then I paused because I took a break! Bio I actually didnt play that long. So feedback&Suggestions are welcome.

Also as a Side Note; I didnt touch any of the cheese tactics I didnt bother to nerv them because: Its the player's choice if they want to defeat the boss/enemy with a cheese tactic (ex: Shock Coma+Subversion) or if they want to have fun while killing them by using a different non cheese strat. Also a pic of the last boss: https://i.imgur.com/QhJRkim.png.

Sonny 43 Stage MOD

So I made a Sonny 2 mod which changes a bit of the gameplay and changes (some) Stages and adds 40 new Stages in to Zone 7 with Story Dialogues (no Voice)!!!

New Armor and Level cap increased to 40. A new Ally who joins in the Tunnel! And another Ally who joins in Zone 6! I also removed Nerveshock and Replaced it with Shadow Nuke. (You can upgrade it). In the rar file I also included a txt file of all

Abilities in Sonny 2(+the new abilities which came with the mod)

The Ids of Armors in Sonny 2(+the new Armor which came with the mod)

All buffs in Sonny 2(+the new Buffs which came with the mod)

Enemie Abilities in Sonny 2017+the Ids so you can change it from the in files its easy.(+the new abilities which came with my Sonny 2017 mod)

A list of all Enemies etc from Sonny 2
